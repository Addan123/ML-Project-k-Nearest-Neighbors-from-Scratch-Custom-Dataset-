# ML-Project-k-Nearest-Neighbors-from-Scratch-Custom-Dataset-
A pure Python and NumPy implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Covers supervised (classification, regression) and unsupervised (k-Means) learning. Using “Your Data.csv,” it demonstrates preprocessing, distance metrics, model evaluation, and visualization — connecting machine learning theory with practical, hands-on understanding.

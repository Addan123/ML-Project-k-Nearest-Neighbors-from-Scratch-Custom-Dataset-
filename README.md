# ML-Project-k-Nearest-Neighbors-from-Scratch-Custom-Dataset-
A pure Python and NumPy implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Covers supervised (classification, regression) and unsupervised (k-Means) learning. Using “Your Data.csv,” it demonstrates preprocessing, distance metrics, model evaluation, and visualization — connecting machine learning theory with practical, hands-on understanding.




# 🧠 From Data to Decisions: k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) from Scratch

This repository contains a **complete, from-scratch implementation** of the **k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)** algorithm — one of the simplest yet most powerful machine learning algorithms.

The project is designed to provide a **hands-on understanding** of:
- Supervised vs Unsupervised learning
- Model training and evaluation
- Loss functions and distance metrics
- Algorithmic thinking by implementing ML logic manually

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📊 Works with your **own dataset** (`practice data.csv`)
- ⚙️ Automatically detects **classification or regression**
- 🧩 Implements kNN **from scratch** (no scikit-learn)
- 🧮 Includes **Euclidean & Manhattan** distance options
- 📉 Evaluates performance using **Accuracy / MSE**
- 🌈 Visualizes decision boundaries (via PCA)
- 🔍 Adds **unsupervised extension** using k-Means clustering
- 🧾 Cleanly structured & Google Colab–ready

Would you like me to generate a **`requirements.txt`** file too (so people can `pip install -r requirements.txt` to run it easily)?  
That’s usually the next step before you push this project to GitHub.
